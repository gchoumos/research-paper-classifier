# Research Paper Classifier - Kaggle Competition
This repository holds my implementation of a Machine Learning project in the context of the **Data Science Challenge** course. This course is part of the Master's Degree in Data Science of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

It is actually a Kaggle competition which can be found in the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/m35216f-article-classification-challenge

The main idea is that we are given textual and graph-theoretical information regarding scientific articles
* ID
* Abstract
* Title
* Authors
* Publication year
* Citations

and we are asked to predict the category of each. There are 28 different categories that are based on the journal in which they were published. 

The project is not yet ready, although the current results are promising. The next steps will be mainly regarding code-refactoring and better engineering of the whole solution. Then the plan is to add visualisations for the various features, probably by importing them to Tableau.

This README file will be soon updated with a detailed walk through the code and a description of the plan of attack to the problem.
